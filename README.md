# gameoflife

This implementation of the Game Of Life uses JavaScript and html5 canvas
to show a grid with a random initial seed that then evolves one step at a time
in a time interval determined by the slider.

The preset buttons show two patterns that have been found - the glider and the pulsar.

Random will generate a random cell distribution occupying roughly 40% of the grid.
This is so there is a balance between overcrowding and underpopulation.
